# VIROMEdash - Global Virome Sequence Metadata Visualizer 

## What is VIROMEdash?

VIROMEdash is a visualizer for [NCBI Virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) that mines the existing records and presents insights over five major metadata dimensions (taxonomy class, host-organism, geography, collection date, and Baltimore class). The portal is dynamic and visuals are interactive with options for download. Showcased are mined results of NCBI Virus data, up-to-date as of May 2022 and, also allows users to upload their own dataset or an accession list from NCBI Nucleotide/Protein/Virus database.

## Web Server

VIROMEdash is publicly available at [https://viromedash-38b937dd7be3.herokuapp.com/](https://viromedash-38b937dd7be3.herokuapp.com/).
